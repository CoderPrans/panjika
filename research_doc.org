* Calculation
  Requirements: Moon Ecliptic Long (Ml.), Sun Ecliptic Long (Sl.)

** Tithi
   long-diff: (- Ml Sl)
   paksha: (if (> long-diff 0) "Shukla" "Krishna")
   tithi: (->> (/ long-diff 12) Math/floor int)

** Nakshatra
   convert Azm to Ecliptic deg
   divide by 13deg 20min or 60/8 (13.33333...4)
